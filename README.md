# ramen-and-vitamins
A balanced diet for your RL bot to grow on.

## Overview
There's some ramen, and there's some vitamins. The ramen makes it tasty, the vitamins make it healthy.

### Huh?
The `ramen` package has all the stuff that gives a bot its unique flavor--its 
brains and personality. What makes a bot unique and tasty. The `vitamins`, on the other hand, are 
pretty much the same handful of really important ingredients from bot to bot.

So, most of the stuff in `ramen` is example code that you'll end up modifying or discarding. 
But the `vitamins` are useful classes and routines to take the tedium out of bot making. You 
may extend the code, or you may never touch it, just use it in your `ramen`.
